- Watching [[PostgreSQL Data Manipulation Playbook]]
	- [[ANSI SQL-92]] defined three concurrency phenomenons
		- **Dirty Read**
		- **Non-repeatable Read**
		- **Phantom Rows**
	- ANSI SQL defines four transaction isolation levels
		- **Read Uncommitted** - not supported in Postgres. Although `begin transaction insolation level read uncommitted` is a valid statement in Postgres the behaviour will be the same as Read Committed.
		- **Read Committed** - dirty reads are not allowed
		- **Repeatable Read** - standard allows Phantom Reads, but Postgres does not. This is because in repeatable read mode the query will reuse snapshots rather than always get a new one.
		- **Serializable** - Phantom Rows are not permitted. Transactions execute as if they were executed one at a time. It also prevents [[Serialisation Anomalies]].
	- Postgres has trasnaction save points with standard syntax.
	- `start work` is synonymous to `begin transaction`
	- The `insert into` statement has interesting elements: `overriding`, `on conflict` and `returning`
	- The `insert into` can ignore conflicts by specifying `on conflict do nothing`.
	- The `insert into` can act as merge by specifying `on conflict do update set`.
	- `update only Table` prevents descendent tables updates
	- `update Table *` explicitly includes descendent tables updates
	- `delete from Table using...` but `update Table from...`
