- Listened to [[ICAgile (ICP-ASD): Evolving Architecture and Design]]
	- A good refresher of why architecture is necessary even in agile with a lot of references to books already on my bookshelf.
	- How does Conway's Law apply to my environment right now?
- Listened to [[Rust Fundamentals]]
	- Rust is focused on runtime security.
	- It is compiled not interpreted but runs on many platforms from a single code base
	- The language takes care of memory management, but unlike Java or C# there is no garbage collector, the memory handling is added at compile time by the compiler.
	- There are no nulls and by default variables are immutable.
