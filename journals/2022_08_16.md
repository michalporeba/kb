	- Sorting algorithms explained
	- Text search algorithms explained
		- naive with complexity of O(n+m) but no preprocessing
		- Boyer-Moore-Horspool - preprocessing to create bad match table. Complexity on average O(n/m) with worst case O(n+m)
	- Binary Search Trees - unbalanced tree is where the hight of branches are different.
	- A balanced tree is one that stays balanced regardless of the order in which the data is added.
	- balance factor is the hights of left and right child nodes.
	- AVL - a self balancing binary tree named after inventors: Adelson-Velsky and Landis. There are four balancing rotations: left, right, left-right and right-left.
