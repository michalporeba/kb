- Reading [[Linked Data: Structured data on the Web]]
	- [[SPARQL]] - didn't use to be an acronym. The SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language is something that was added later.
	- ARQ query tool from Apache Jena Project can be used to query RDF fiiles using SPARQL from command line
	- [[Quote]]: [[Linked Data]] isn't meant to be used only by humans; automated processes should also be able to make [[SPARQL]] queries. (page 108)
	- **SELECT** and **ASK** query types return values but not in a graph. **DESCRIBE** and **CONSTRUCT** are used to return results as graphs.
	- [[RDFa]] vocabulary attributes can be used in [[HTML5]] only on tags defined in HTML5.
	- [[Schema.org]] is just a vocabulary. [[GoodRelations]] is another.
	- [[RDFa 1.1 Light]] was created after early adopters of the technology and [[Schema.org]] complained that it was too complex.
