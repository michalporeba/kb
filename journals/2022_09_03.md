- Watching [[StringBuilder Internals]]
	- It is possible to manually set `sb.Capacity` by simply assigning a value to it. If capacity is being reduced and is se to less than the current length the exception will be thrown. But increasing it ahead of time might improve performance as fewer back linked chunks will be created.
	- String builder has `Insert()`, `Replace()` and `Remove()` methods
	- Creating a `StringBuilder` is not free, so in some use cases it might be worth maintaining the object in memory and using `sb.Clear()` to reset it. In the corse demo this has shown 1/3 of time of the constructor.
	- It is possible to access individual characters to get or set them using an indexer. But because of the back linked chunks it is an O(n) not O(1) operation as it would be if it was a string or an array.
	- `sb.GetChunks()` allows to access data without creating strings, for example to stream the data over a network connection.
	- It is possible to use `StringBuilder` to hurt performance, so it is easy to benchmark solutions that intend to optimise performance.
