- Listening to [[The Future of Python]]
	- Python's development was rather chaotic until 2012, but since then, since the introduction and stabilisation of Python 3 the velocity of change (measured by PEPs per year) has levelled off. The language is the most popular (according to some metrics) in the world and its popularity is self sustaining, so it is reasonable to expect it will remain a key player for quite some time.
	- The course offered more of an opinion rather than learning opportunity.
	- An interesting point was raised that while according to the zen of python there should be one way to do a thing the tooling around python is a myriad of ways to do things and the author expects that is where the python ecosystem will change in the future, maturing into more prescribed way of working with python.
- Listening to [[Becoming a Better Listener]]
	- Many concepts are similar to those from [[Speed Reading]]. Think about intent. What do you want to get out of listening? Plan what to listen to. Think about outcomes and specific strategies for retention
	- Listen to understand not to respond - a very common mistake.
