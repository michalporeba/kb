- Watching [[Google Firebase: The Big Picture]]
	- Definition of a 'framework': a library that provides a fundamental structure.
	- There are firebase 'helpers':
		- FirebaseUI - offers optimised UI components - simple javascript UI library. It can integrate with authentication. There are versions for web, android and iOS.
		- GeoFire - realtime location queries
		- FirebaseJobDispatcher - schedules background jobs
		- FirePad - code and text editor online
		- Firebase Tools - CLI - can run local web server
		- Firebase Import - for importing large JSON files into the realtime database
		- Flashlight - elastic search
	- Authentication as a Service, File Storage, Database backups, Autoscaling, CLI
	- It has a free tier.
	- Why not to use Firebase
		- There are limits on the SDK, and it has only NoSQL storage
		- Data storage is moved across multiple servers in google and is not 'yours'
		- That export is not very easy.
		- It is impossible to develop offline (is this really true? most likely this can be remedied with good architecture)
