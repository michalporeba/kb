- Reading [[Linked Data on the Web]]
	- [[Quote]] [[Linke Data]] definition: "Linked Data is about employing the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to publish structured data on the Web and to connect data between different data sources, effectively allowing data in one data source to be linked to data in another data source."
	- [[Linked Data]] was first [outlined](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html) by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] in [[2006]]
	- The Web of Data can be queried and returns linked data which should enable a new class of applications similar to the revolution the HTML brought on.
