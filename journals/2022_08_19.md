- Watching [[C# 10 : The Big Picture]]
	- one of top 5 languages in the world
	- C# developed in the context of C++ and Java, building and improving on both.
	- C# like Java throws exceptions in places where C++ would execute with undefined behaviour (or crash)
	- C# is resilient to non-breaking changes in libraries.
	- C#'s assemblies in Intermediate Langauge (IL) are equivalent to Java's Byte Code
	- Machine code is generated just in time by the execution engine. It happens on a function level and happens only once for the runtime of application. This allows performance close to native application and significantly better over REPL type interpreted languages.
