- Listening to [[Cultivating Effective Relationships in Virtual Work]]
	- Virtual work environment requires change of approach.
	- The course itself follows a made up scenario of a group of people working on a project. In this sense it reminds me the [[#NoEstimates]] book.
	- It references the [[How to Win Friends and Influence People]] book.
	- Teams come in foud different types
		- **Management types** - where there is a strong top down management
		- **Ad-hoc teams** - where managers know little about specific types people do
		- **Project teams** - manager have little oversight - sometimes this, and the lack of leadership can lead to lack of engagement
		- **Technical project teams** - mostly remote
	- The course has some good content, but many solutions and descriptions appear to be very American and not directly comparable to British office dynamics.
	- One of the solutions presented is to call people more. This, while sometimes useful, might be counterproductive when interactive with people from newer generations who don't normally use phone. This is well explained in the [[Digital Body Language: How to Build Trust & Connection no Matter the Distance]]
	- There is a lot of emphasis on *listening to non-verbal communication*.
