- Watching [[StringBuilder Internals]]
	- An explanation of how [[StringBuilder]] works in [[StringBuilder Internals]]
	- the course is applicable to .net versions 1.0 to 6.0
	- `StringBuilder` class should be used when we are planning multiple changes to the string. This is because strings in .net are immutable.
	- If the number of concatenations is known in advance in a function then IL produced takes this into account and calls `String::Concat` only once. Still, multiple string literals are created, but they produce only a single string.
	- However, if a condition or a loop are involved, then multiple strings will be created.
	- Creating multiple temporary strings when only one is returned can have negative performance impact.
	- `string.Create<object?>` introduced in .net 6.
	- By default a new `StringBuilder` has capacity for 16 characters
	- In .Net6 appending interpolating strings to the builder has been optimised and in the resulting IL it doesn't create the temporary variable.
	- `sb.AppendLine(...)` automatically appends system specific new line character.
	- Internally reversed linked list of chunks is used with each chunk equal to the double size of the last capacity starting with the initial.
	- `sb.AppendJoin(Char, Object[])` and `sb.AppendJoin(String, Object[])` are available.
	- `sb.AppendFormat(...)` is equivalent to `string.Format()` but with optimisation of directly writing to the string builder without allocating memory for the string.
