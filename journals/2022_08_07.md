- Watching [[Fundamentals of Distributed Systems]]
	- Building distributed systems often includes designing interaction between distributed teams and organisations.
	- Distributed systems are complex and require specialists skills to keep them running.
	- The units are built as independent solutions, but are run as an integrated system.
	- System operators perspective is important in distributed systems. They need to be able to make sense of what's going on to support and operate it.
	- Although [[DevOps]] combined the development and operation into a single team but the mindset still is different and the team needs to take care of both. Focus goes from planned behaviours to handling unplanned anomalies.
	- (my notes: the focus on looking at individual elements looks strange, especially when importance of ERD diagrams is shown for a microservice and as an important element of a Run Book).
