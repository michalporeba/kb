- Watching [[Fundamentals of Distributed Systems]]
	- Kafka and dealing with dead letter queues. Alert, locate, diagnose, correct. Messages in the dead letter queue are not problems but rather symptoms of a problem.
	- If distributed systems logging is especially important.
	- The section on logging is full off operational problems. Logging SQL statements and parameters, parameters sent to functions. That potentially makes logs sensitive and the access more difficult and so the logs less rather than more useful.
	- There is a case made for correlated tracing across services by using headers passing a correlation ID between services.
	- A wider scope correlation IDs could be added to manage 'state' of the wider system across services, so rather than correlating a single user request, that wider correlation ID binds things that have to happen to perform a business operation.
	- Events should be immutable, so rollback have to be done by compensating transactions.
	- **If you don't need a distributed system, don't build one!**
	- If you need one, use mathematics to help you. Build it right.
