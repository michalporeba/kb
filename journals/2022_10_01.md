- Reading [[Ambulance Care Practice]] - [[Anaphylaxis]]
	- [[Anaphylaxis]] is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and is life-threatening [[Muraro, 2014]]. It is usually associated with skin and mucosal changes [[Soar, 2008]].
	- Death is unlikely more than six hours after exposure to a trigger, but cardiac arrest can occur in minutes, particularly if the trigger is medication that has been administered intravenously.
	- 20% of anaphylaxis cases do not have skin and/or mucosal changes, particularly reactions that occur intra-operatively in adults and food/insect sting-induced reactions in children. Patients with severe anaphylaxis resulting in significant hypotension may not exhibit any cutaneous symptoms until their blood pressure is restored.
